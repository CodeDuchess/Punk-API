# Punk-API
Overall Goal: To consume Punk-API beer data and display, style and filter the data. Tools used include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vue.js. The code can be viewed in this repository and the page can be viewed at 

Design goal: Imagery was chosen that would stir the emotions and illicit thoughts of leisure time and comradery. I also used a color palette of warm reds, oranges and browns. Research has indicated that red and orange tones stimulate thirst and hunger and therefore would be appropriate for a client in the food and beverage industry.
